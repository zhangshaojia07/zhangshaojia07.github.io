Hello, world.

This is the very first article on my new independent blog, built with Hugo and the Terminal theme.

For the past few years most of my writing has been on [Cnblogs](https://www.cnblogs.com/shaojia) and [Luogu Blog](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/101868/article) — both in Simplified Chinese. From now on, the focus of my blog updates will no longer be on these two platforms. This time I'm starting a new space where I plan to write primarily in English.

A quick introduction: I'm Shaojia, currently based in Hangzhou.

This blog will most likely feature a mix of mathematics, English learning, technical notes, problem editorials, small experiments, and whatever random thoughts I feel like writing down.

If you're interested in more background, I'll prepare a proper [About](/about/) page soon.

At least for now, this blog uses [the Terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal). It looks so cool!

Thanks for stopping by — more posts coming.
